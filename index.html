                <h2>Programming Haiku</h2>
                <p align="center">Programming is fun.<br> Websites and Databases.<br> I prefer Back-end.</p>
                <p>I wanted to write a simple little haiku in 5-7-5 and writing about programming just made sense</p>

                <h2>My personal Interests</h2>
                <p>The original reason I became interested in programming as a kid was a love of Video Games. I basically grew up on my DS, PS2, and Wii. This is still largely the case with my Switch and PC games, especially with all the games that I can share and enjoy with my friends. </p>
                <p>Despite video games starting me on it, programming itself has become something I enjoy all on its own. I dont typically program recreationally, but when I do I really enjoy the math and logic that goes into solving problems. Creating a program and seeing it to completion is one of the most satisfying feelings out there for me.</p>
                <p>One of my hobbies to try and keep myself from spending all day online is Volleyball. I started it in my Senior year of high school and absolutely loved it. Its a great way to encourage yourself to stay in shape and exercise. Between the people that I've met and the experience I've gained playing the sport, Volleyball is absolutely one of my favorite passtimes.</p>
